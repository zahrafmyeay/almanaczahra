                <p>
                    A metaphor in the Cambridge dictionary means an expression that describes a person or object by referring to something considered to possess similar characteristics, such as: wolf in sheep’s clothing that refers to a person with pleasant appearance that hide the fact they are evil (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). 
                <br><br>
                Metaphors are included in literature, such as poetry, folklore, and painting. Metaphors are commonly used even in daily conversation(Matrix english team, 2017).
                <br><br>
                The word metaphor comes from Greek. Meta means beyond hero means to carry. Metaphors carry meaning from one entity to another. A metaphor invites understanding something to produce a more meaningful experience (Schumacher, 2020).

                <p>Artists or painters commonly use metaphors to express their emotions or ideologies. The statement can be proven in almost all paintings, which is how the artist uses the colour and visual elements that they drew to state the feeling or message and even the deeper connection between the artist and their artwork (Deshpande, 2021).
                    <br><br>
                    Some people might question what happened in the artwork. The unanswered question keeps people engaged and brings the audience's perspective into the narrative (Deshpande, 2021). 
                    <br><br>
                    For instance, Forest fire illustrates a fight between buffalo and two lions, symbolising the battle between Indonesian and lion as the Dutch. His painting contains signs that need to be deciphered (Low et al., 2017, 67, 74).</p>

                <p>The painting "Between Life and Death" displays several visual elements that focus on a figure of 2 lions and a buffalo with the flat ground with rocks, bushes, and dust. The buffalo's buffalo's eyes filled with tears and mixed feelings such as sadness, fury, and grief (Fauzie 2019, 223). 
                    <br><br>
                    The lion is a metaphor for the king of Europe, the kingdom of the Netherlands and the invaders (since the lion is often associated with the king of a jungle). The emblem of the lion is also invariably used to symbolise European monarchies such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, in which most Europeans were fond of colonising other nations to expand their territory in the past. Lion has a character that is aggressive, controlling, and superior. (Fauzie 2019, 224). 
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, the buffalo is identifiable as a metaphor for Indigenous Indonesians because the buffalo is an animal close to Indonesian as a helper on a farm to plough the soil. The symbolisation embodied in Indonesian student organisations in the Netherlands includes the head icon of the buffalo as a part of the emblem (Fauzie, 2019, 227).</p>
