                <p>
                    Romanticism is an art movement that emerged from France and Britain. It was famous around the 19th century. Romantic art is embodied as a natural landscape that emphasises imagination and emotion, for instance Evening: Landscape with an Aqueduct by Theodere Gericault. (Galitz, 2004). <br> <br>  Romanticism can be a medium for the painter to express their emotional state, such as playing with colour, for instance, dark clouds as a metaphor to convey an unsettling feeling and some portrait paintings to show the person's personality, ambition and mood (Galitz, 2004).

                <p>TRomanticism is derived from the word romance, which refers to a tale or ballad of heroism, adventure, and war, along with elegant formality and classical form (The editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2024b).<br><br> Romanticism was first defined as literature in 1790 by a poet of history and theoretical writings. During the second phase in 1805, there was an increased sense of nationalism because it involved the unity and loyalty of people to the nation, such as preserving stories, native folklore, poetry and dance (The editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2024b). 
                    <br> <Br>
                    Romanticism as an art movement is introduced by the British artist around the 1760 and 70s and spread the awareness by the French philosopher Denis Diderot a decade later. It began and is well known in Europe from the 18th century to the mid-19th century (Galitz, 2004).
                    <br><br>	
                    The Romantic era ended in the late nineteenth century. It was replaced by Realism, which opposed Romanticism because it illustrated everyday life and accurate depiction, while Romanticism was based on the emotion and imagination of the painter (Galitz, 2004; The editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2024a).</p>

                <p>This painting has been considered one of the masterpieces of the Romantic movement and its quintessential artwork. He painted the landscape of nature along with his ominous emotion between beauty and terror. The painting did not depict real nature but was based on his various sketches of places he visited. The man standing in the painting has multiple interpretations, such as being believed to be the artist himself or a portrait of forestry officials. The artwork was mysterious and showed how he used dark colours to express foreboding imagery (Artbel, 2012; Honigman, 2001)
                    <br><br>
                    The painting illustrates a man with a cane standing upon a rock and gazing at the landscape before him, wearing a dark green overcoat and boots (Artbel, 2012).</p>
