                <p>
                    The battle of Anghiary occurred on June 29 1440, in Italy and is also considered a fundamental fight of the 15th century. Leonardo was commissioned to create a mural in the excellent Palazzo Vecchio, Florence council hall. This artwork is designed to commemorate the Florentine victory over Milan. The painting depicted several men on war and horses embracing the ferocious conflict for possessing a heraldic standard (The Battle of Anghiari, by Leonardo Da Vinci, 2017).
                    <br><br>
                    This artwork is also known as "The Lost Leonardo". Many people are still debating whether Leonardo's lost masterpiece still exists. Some said it was concealed in Palazzo Vecchio hall, or the artwork was never painted. However, there was a lot of evidence of record left by Leonardo that he studied to draw to represent the figure and battles of Anghiary (Redazione, 2021).

                <p>The artwork portrays Washington's attack on the Hessians at Trenton during the American Revolutionary War. It occurred on December 25, 1776, but the artwork was created in 1851. The artwork displayed is not the first subject since he had done it once in 1849, but an accident fire in his studio damaged it. The painting is for commercial use since Marshall O Robers bought it for $10,000. It changed ownership and was eventually donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Spassky, 1985, 1).
                    <br><br>
                     The Washington Crossing Delaware by Leutze excited several congressmen and was presumed to be flourishing nationalism, "The great national painting" of the period (Spassky, 1985, 1).	 </p>

                <p>The arrest of Prince Diponegoro illustrates the vital scene of Prince Diponegoro being captured by the Dutch. It is the only history painting that he ever made, which shows that Saleh has undergone the development of his painting and his idea of nationhood, opposing Colonialism. The painting became the best-known history painting of the first half of the 19th century and is regarded as the father of Indonesian modern art (Krauss, 2005, 290) (Low et al., 2017, 76) </p>
