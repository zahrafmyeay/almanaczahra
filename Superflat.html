				</div>
				<p>Superflat, a Japanese art movement launched by Takashi Murakami, moves into the energetic bold world of pop culture. Inspired from Japan's long tradition of "flat" art forms like woodblock prints, it shows the vibrant world of manga and anime. The visualization of the movement results in bold, colorful works that often reference popular characters or trends. Unlike many art movements with strict definitions, Superflat thrives on artistic freedom. This allows artists to explore themes that resonate with them, from the effects of consumerism and media saturation to deeper reflections on aspects of Japanese culture. Through these interpretations, Superflat challenges traditional boundaries between high and low art, offering a playful and thoughtful commentary on contemporary society.

				<p>Born in 1962 in Tokyo, Murakami’s artistic background was in the precise, laborious mastering of traditional Japanese painting, which he studied for 11 years, specialising in the field of Nihonga painting, a refined form of watercolour practice, whose subjects, most often flowers and landscapes, are as traditional as its techniques. Concurrently with his studies, Murakami continued to nurture his passion for manga and anime, the comics and animated films of his native country. One might assume, on first looking at Murakami’s images, that his interest in these modern idioms entirely supplanted his training in the time-honoured forms of Japanese art. But closer inspection reveals that they have an enduring presence. (Luke 2007)

				<p>Yoshitomo Nara was born in 1959 in Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. His father and grandfather were Shinto priests, which was an artistic influence over Nara’s artwork. Nara has completed about 40 solo exhibitions during his 36-year professional artistic career. He currently runs his art practice from Tokyo, Japan. Nara has never used assistants to create the bodies of artwork that he has produced. There is a focus of isolation in his work throughout every series. Early on in Nara’s career, he admits that he focused on things that just piqued his interest. However, after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, Nara had a paradigm shift in his work and his thought process. Nara insinuated that he didn’t exercise a deep thought process previously and that he now has deeper, more meaningful conversations with himself through his art practice. It seems that after this natural disaster, Nara’s work also shifts to focus more on nature and Nara’s surrounding environment. Nara also uses elements of spiritual themes throughout his body of work. His work is often interpreted as being heavily influenced by Japanese manga, but Nara does not seem to think this had anything to do with his style of work. (Sawyer 2021)
