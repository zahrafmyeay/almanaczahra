				</div>
				<p>The distinction between "high" and "low" art is a big debate in the art world. Traditionally, high art refers to works considered serious, intellectually stimulating, and often created using classical techniques. Paintings, sculptures, and operas would typically fall under this category. Low art, sometimes referred to as popular art, encompasses more accessible and commercially-driven forms of expression. Comic books, video games, and even some mass-produced paintings might be considered low art. However, these categories are not always clear. Some argue that the value of art shouldn't be tied to popularity, while others see value in the accessibility of low art. Additionally, artists like Andy Warhol and Takashi Murakami blurred the lines by incorporating pop culture imagery into high art. Today, the focus is often shifting towards appreciating the artistic value within a work itself, regardless of its category.

				<p>Born in 1962 in Tokyo, Murakami’s artistic background was in the precise, laborious mastering of traditional Japanese painting, which he studied for 11 years, specialising in the field of Nihonga painting, a refined form of watercolour practice, whose subjects, most often flowers and landscapes, are as traditional as its techniques. Concurrently with his studies, Murakami continued to nurture his passion for manga and anime, the comics and animated films of his native country. One might assume, on first looking at Murakami’s images, that his interest in these modern idioms entirely supplanted his training in the time-honoured forms of Japanese art. But closer inspection reveals that they have an enduring presence. (Luke 2007)

				<p>In 1955 Jeff Koons began his life in York, Pennsylvania. He started his higher education at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore in 1972. Koons also attended school for a year at the Art Institute in Chicago. After graduating in 1976 with a Bachelor in Fine Arts from Maryland Institute College of Art, he decided to move to New York (Guggenheim Museum). Koons resides and works in both New York and York, Pennsylvania. (Erica 2009)
